title: Skeleton Development
type: major
---

This is the first draft of a style package page for Penrose, meaning a static
API to serve the source code for linear algebra style. This wasn't a huge amount
of work because it was modified from the dsl equivalent repository.

**Changes:**

* Jekyll skeleton template and theme developed, modified from penrose.github.io
* The user can distinguish the main docs from a plugin docs by the color (deep pink here)
* Repository structure modified to serve a static JSON API
